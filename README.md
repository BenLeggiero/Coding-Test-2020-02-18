# [Coding Test 2020-02-18](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-2020-02-18) #

A coding test I performed on 2020-02-18


## `// TODO:` ##

Here are things I started working on, or intended to work on, but which are not complete at time of submission:

* Seek bar
    * I think this would be reasonably straightforward, but I just didn't have time to get to it. You'll see some references to it in the code because of this.
* Design
    * Since the time constraints only allowed for "just get it working and then ship it", I couldn't spend any time on the app's design. As such, I just used the default Android "Master-Detail" design.
* Documentation
    * Normally, I document every single API I write. However, because of the time constraints of this assessment, I forewent documentation to rebalance the Quality-Time-Budget triangle closer to Time
